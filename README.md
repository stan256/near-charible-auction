Hello,
My idea for a 5th challenge of a Near Spring Hackathon was a development of decentrilized auction platform, where all spended funds will be forwarded to a charitable funds or different good things. User can place a new lot, to add a bids

- To have an opportunity to choose the fund (at the moment logic only keeps money in the wallet of auction account) for donating
- Beautify the design (particularly, modal window of the creation of the new lot)
- Notify user his bid was beat
- Notify user his bid has won
- Not to store hardcoded token for ipfs storage
- Custom duration of the auction (default is one week)
